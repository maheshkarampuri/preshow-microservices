# The Preshow

The Preshow is a microservices-based ticket booking platform designed to handle high-concurrency seat reservations and event-driven booking workflows across distributed services.

🧩 Problem Statement

Traditional monolithic ticket booking systems struggle with:

High traffic during movie releases

Seat overbooking under concurrent requests

Tight coupling between booking, payment, and inventory

Difficult scalability and deployments

The Preshow addresses these challenges using a microservices architecture with clear service boundaries and independent scalability.
